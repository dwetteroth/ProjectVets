        Apply for Assistance


      %p
        Project V.E.T.S. is currently on hold in granting approval to new Recipient Organizations. We have reached capacity for the number of organizations that we can serve based on the amount of donated inventory we receive. We are, however, still accepting applications from animal welfare groups - all Application Forms will be placed in a queue to be presented to our Program Committee once our donations allow us to support more recipients.  Organizations seeking assistance must be registered as a not-for-profit or non-governmental organization in the country in which they are operating and they must have a veterinarian either on staff or working as a volunteer. If you feel you meet these requirements, please download our application and send it to
        %a{:href => "mailto:info@projectvets.org"}info@projectvets.org
        with any questions.
