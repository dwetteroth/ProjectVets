        Apply for Assistance


      %p
        Project V.E.T.S. is currently accepting applications from animal welfare groups for review in 2015.  Organizations seeking assistance must be registered as a not-for-profit or non-governmental organization in the country in which they are operating and they must have a veterinarian either on staff or working as a volunteer.   If you feel you meet these requirements, please download our application and send it to info@projectvets.org.  All request forms will be placed in a queue as they are received.  Applications are reviewed in June and January of each year.
